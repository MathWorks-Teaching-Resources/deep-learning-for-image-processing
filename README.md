# Teaching digital signal processing using deep learning with MATLABÂ®

## Introduction

This repository contains two lecture modules for image processing using deep learning techniques:
* Image denoising using deep learning
* Semantic image segmentation using deep learning

It is recommended that these modules are introduced in an (elective) image processing class. 

## Content
Each module consists of the following material: 
* Lecture slides (.pdf, power point slides provided upon request)
* Homework assignment (MATLAB live script)
* Homework assignment solution (MATLAB live script, provided upon request)
* Detailed homework assignment instructions for students
* Detailed homework assignment instructions for instructors (provided upon request)

The following materials are also provided for further guidance:
* Syllabus
* Instructions on using image labeler
* A guided tour to image processing using deep learning with MATLAB
* Term project ideas for image processing using deep learning (provided upon request)
